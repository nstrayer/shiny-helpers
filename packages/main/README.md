# `@posit-dev/shiny-binding-main`

This is package contains helpers for setting up input and output bindings for Shiny apps. It assumes that Web Components will be the method of choice for creating custom input and output bindings.

## Want to use React instead of webcomponents? See `@posit-dev/shiny-binding-react`

## Installing

```bash
npm install @posit-dev/shiny-binding-main
```

## Importing/Using

```typescript
import { makeInputBinding } from "@posit-dev/shiny-binding-main";
```

## Functions

### `CustomElementInput`

Typescript interface for the `input` element. Extends the default `HTMLElement` to include the `value` property for holding the input value, and a `notifyBindingOfChange()` method for notifying Shiny of a change in the input value.

### `makeInputBinding()`

Function for creating a custom input binding given a tag name for a custom element (following the `CustomElementInput` interface.) Function takes care of registering input binding to ShinyCustomElementInput.

### `CustomElementOutput`

Typescript interface for the `output` element. Extends the default `HTMLElement` to include the `value` property for holding the output value.

An element that implements this interface should watch for changes in the `value` property and update the rending accordingly.

### `makeOutputBinding()`

Function for creating a custom output binding given a tag name for a custom element (following the `CustomElementOutput` interface.) Function takes care of registering output binding to Shiny.
