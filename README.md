# `@Shiny-Helpers` monorepo

## What

This is a monorepo containing packages for extending Shiny with Javascript/Typescript code.

Currently there are two packages: `@posit-dev/shiny-bindings-core` and `@posit-dev/shiny-bindings-react`. See their respective READMEs for more information. [@posit-dev/shiny-bindings-core](packages/main/README.md) [@posit-dev/shiny-bindings-react](packages/react/README.md).

## Development

Dependencies for both packages can be installed in the root directory with

```bash
npm i
```

Each package needs to be build and deployed separately. See the READMEs for each package for more information.
