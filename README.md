# `@Shiny-Helpers` monorepo

## What

This is a monorepo containing packages for extending Shiny with Javascript/Typescript code.

Currently there are two packages: `@shiny-helpers/main` and `@shiny-helpers/react`. See their respective READMEs for more information. [@shiny-helpers/main](packages/main/README.md) [@shiny-helpers/react](packages/react/README.md).

## Development

Dependencies for both packages can be installed in the root directory with

```bash
npm i
```

Each package needs to be build and deployed separately. See the READMEs for each package for more information.
